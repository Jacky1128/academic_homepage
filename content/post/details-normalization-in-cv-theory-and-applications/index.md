A series of normalization methods have bursted for years and have greatly propelled the development of deep algorithms. It seems quite normal to apply these norm function in various types of deep learning models. However, we may not fully fathom how it works and may remain some misunderstood concepts. Therefore, I would try to explain the details behind Norm operations in this blog post.

I will the blog on the following questions:

**Why we apply Norm in deep algorithms?**

**How many types of Norm we commonly use and how do they work in detail?**

**Do they really solve the problems?**

**Why don't we apply Norm in few-shot learning tasks like others?**
