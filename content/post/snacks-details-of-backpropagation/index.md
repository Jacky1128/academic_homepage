***[Get to know me and my academic blog.](https://zedongwang.netlify.app/post/getting-started/)***

Let us kick off my first post of *Details* series with the core of deep learning, backpropagation algorithm. I would expain the mathematical details of backprop elaborately in the following order:

* **Jacobian and Hessian matrix.**
* **Backward differentiation with Jacobian matrix.**
* **General Backpropagation algorithm.**
* **Others to be updated.**

[Coming soon.]
