I am Zedong Wang, a 21-year-old Hong Kong junior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Electronics Information Engineering (machine intelligence). I would make an introduction for myself from an academic standpoint.

## My research experience

I got my first taste of scientific research when I was a high school student in Shenzhen. I was team leader in school environmental project in which I and my team investigated the environmental damage caused by invasive plants in the green belts of Nanshan District, Shenzhen.  This project was recognized by the local government which gave funding support. This experience in particular shaped my statistical skills as well as communication and presentation skills. More importantly, it stimulated my passion for scientific research.

After I entered college, I began to get into the field of engineering. From 2020 to the beginning of 2021, I was a research intern (remote) at [Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020-2021). During the summer 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at HUST.

## My research interests & attitude

My research interests are within computer vision and deep learning. My advisor often tells me to keep those bells and whistles away and do solid research. As my research recognition is gradually built up, I set an ambition of pursuing mathematically rigorous deep learning research under a relatively pure academic environment. 

I firmly believe that creativity usually comes from details and I eagerly need a pure research enviornment to exert my strengths and abilities. It is exactly the reseaon why I decided to apply for a PHD position directly. Besides, I have planned to make explanations of some theoretical details regularly on my homepage in the form of academic blogs. In my view, it is not only a platform to show my academic foundations, but a testimony of my lifelong learning.

## My research interests & attitude

## Schedules

* **Complete my current few-shot semantic segmentation research topics under Prof. Xinggang Wang before I graduated from HUST.**
* **Update my academic blogs with what I have accumulated these years in my spare time.**
* **Apply for a PHD position in 2023 Fall.**

I firmly believe that I am well-prepared for the coming research and challenges.
