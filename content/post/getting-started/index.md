I am Zedong Wang, a 21-year-old Hong Kong junior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Electronics Information Engineering (machine intelligence). Exploring the "unknown" of surroundings is my cup of tea. The same is true of my research process. The positive feedback is stimulated the moment I try to decompose technical details of deep learning and extend my knowledge scope. It is exactly the main reason why I determined to do deep learning research.

## Step into research

I got my first taste of scientific research in high school. I was selected as head of STEM club and team leader in an environmental project in which I and my team investigated the environmental damage caused by invasive plants in the green belts of Nanshan District, Shenzhen. The project was recognized by the local government which gave funding support. This experience in particular shaped my overall research mindset as well as communication and presentation skills. 

After entering my college, I dabbled in deep learning especially deep computer vision. At the end of 2020, I became a research intern (remote) at [Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Dr. Xiaoping Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TpX2C3cAAAAJ). My overall computer vision recognition and research methodology have been made in this period with specific remote sensing semantic segmentation projects.  In the summer 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student at [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was mainly responsible for computer vision model configuration and data selection in the group of [Dr. Bin Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9WhK1y4AAAAJ) and [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ). What I have primarily gained from this visiting experience is the clear recognition of the whole computer vision research pipeline instead of merely focusing on algorithm design. I have experienced and adapted into the life of being a researcher and after this summer. Besides, I am able to examine computer vision issues from more comprehensive and mature point of view.



I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at HUST.

## Insterests & Attitude

My research interests are within computer vision and deep learning. As my research goes deeper, I have realized that novelties usually come from the exploration of details. Therefore, I set myself an academic goal of keeping those bells and whistles away and pursuing solid, mathematically interpretable deep learning research. It is exactly the reseaon why I determined to apply for a PHD position directly. Besides, I have planned to make explanations of  theoretical details of deep learning regularly on my academic blog. In my view, it is a testimony of my lifelong learning.

## Schedules

* **Complete my current few-shot semantic segmentation research topics under Prof. Xinggang Wang before I graduated from HUST.**
* **Update my academic blogs with what I have accumulated these years in my spare time.**
* **Apply for a PHD position in 2023 Fall.**

I have prepared myself well for the following research and challenges.
