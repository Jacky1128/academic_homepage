I am Zedong Wang, a Hong Kong senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I was a deep learning research intern (remote) at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020-2021). In the summer of 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).


Prof. Xingggang Wang often tells me to keep those bells and whistles away and do solid research. With the deepening of computer vision, I gradually set an ambition of pursuing mathematically rigorous academic.
My academic desire now is to do solid and interpretable deep learning research under a pure academic environment.
