I am Zedong Wang, a Hong Kong senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Welcome to my academic blog. I would make a brief introduction about myself from an academic standpoint.

## Research Experience

I got my first taste of scientific research when I was a high school student. research intern (remote) at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020-2021). In the summer of 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).

## Research Interests and Attitude

My research interests are within computer vision and deep learning. Prof. Xingggang Wang often tells me to keep those bells and whistles away and do solid research. As my research recognition is gradually built up, I set an ambition of pursuing mathematically rigorous deep learning research under a relatively pure academic environment. 
## My Academic Blog
It is exactly the reseaon why I decided to build this academic blog and apply for a PHD position directly. I firmly believe that creativity usually comes from details. I have planned to make explanations of some theoretical details regularly on my homepage in the form of academic blogs.
