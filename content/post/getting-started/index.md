I am Zedong Wang, a Hong Kong senior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I was a deep learning research intern (remote) at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020-2021). In the summer 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).


My academic desire is to pursue solid and interpretable deep learning research under a pure academic environment. My advisor often tells me to keep those bells and whistles away and do solid and worthwhile research. With the deepening of computer vision, I gradually set an ambition of pursuing mathematically and logically rigorous academic.
