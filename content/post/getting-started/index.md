I am Zedong Wang, a 21-year-old Hong Kong junior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Electronics Information Engineering (machine intelligence). Exploring the "unknown" of the surroundings is my cup of tea. The same is true of my research process. The positive feedback cycle can be stimulated the moment I try to decompose technical details of deep learning and extend my knowledge scope. It is exactly the main reason why I determined to do deep learning research.

## Step into research

I got my first taste of scientific research in high school. I was selected as head of STEM club and team leader in an environmental project in which I and my team investigated the environmental damage caused by invasive plants in the green belts of Nanshan District, Shenzhen. The project was recognized by the local government which gave funding support. This experience in particular shaped my overall research mindset as well as communication and presentation skills. 

After entering my college, I dabbled in deep learning especially deep computer vision. At the end of 2020, I became a research intern (remote) at [Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Dr. Xiaoping Du](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=TpX2C3cAAAAJ). My overall computer vision recognition and research methodology have been made in this period with specific remote sensing semantic segmentation projects.  In the summer 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student at [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was mainly responsible for computer vision model configuration and data selection in the group of [Dr. Bin Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=9WhK1y4AAAAJ) and [Prof. Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ). What I have primarily gained from this visiting experience is the clear recognition of the whole computer vision research pipeline instead of merely focusing on algorithm design. I have experienced and adapted into the life of being a researcher and after this summer. Besides, I am able to examine computer vision issues from more comprehensive and mature point of view.

I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at HUST. I am dedicated to improving the generalizibility of few-shot segmentation model under the periodic learning setting.

## Insterests & Attitude

My research interests are within few-shot segmentation, metric learning and deep learning. I would love to do deeper research within general deep learning and AI+ in the future. As I go deeper, I have realized that novelties usually come from the exploration of details. Therefore, I set myself an academic goal of keeping those bells and whistles away and pursuing solid, mathematically interpretable deep learning research. Besides, I have planned to make explanations of  theoretical details of deep learning regularly on my academic blog. In my view, it is a testimony of my lifelong learning. However, to be honest, it is not realistic for me to do sound research whole-heartedly as an undergraduate these years. I am really grateful for the intern and visiting chances that make me live the life of being a pure researcher, which is also what I am eager for. Therefore, it is exactly the reseaon why I determined to apply for a PHD position directly. An opportunity to apply myself to deep learning research in a relatively pure research environment is what I am desired for. 

## Schedules

* **Complete my few-shot semantic segmentation research before my graduation.**
* **Update my academic blogs regularly.**
* **Apply for PHD in 2023 Fall.**

I have prepared myself well for the following research and challenges.
