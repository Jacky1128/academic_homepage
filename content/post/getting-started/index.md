I am Zedong Wang (王泽栋), a Hong Kong senior student majoring in Electronics Information Engineering (machine intelligence) at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I would make an introduction for myself from an academic standpoint.

## My research experience

I got my first taste of scientific research the moment I was a high school student at Nanshan Foreign Language School, Shenzhen. I was team leader in school environmental project in which I and my team nvestigated the environmental damage caused by invasive plants in the green belts of Nanshan District, Shenzhen.  This project was recognized by the local government which gave funding support. This experience in particular shaped my statistical skills as well as communication and presentation skills. More importantly, it stimulated my passion for scientific research.

After I entered college, I began to get into the field of engineering. I was a research intern (remote) at [Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (2020-2021). In the summer of 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of [Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at HUST.

## My research interests & attitude

My research interests are within computer vision and deep learning. Prof. Xingggang Wang often tells me to keep those bells and whistles away and do solid research. As my research recognition is gradually built up, I set an ambition of pursuing mathematically rigorous deep learning research under a relatively pure academic environment. It is exactly the reseaon why I decided to build this academic blog and apply for a PHD position directly. I firmly believe that creativity usually comes from details. I have planned to make explanations of some theoretical details regularly on my homepage in the form of academic blogs.
