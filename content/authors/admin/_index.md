I am currently a third-year undergraduate student in Electronics Information Engineering at [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). I am working on few-shot semantic segmentation under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ). My research interests are within visual representation learning and deep learning. Besides, I am also insterested in probabilistic deep learning and AI+ applications. My academic goal is to fathom and get a good grasp of details of deep learning theory as well as do solid and interpretable deep learning research. 

In the summer 2021, I worked as a visiting student at Multimedia Lab (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I was a research intern (remote) at Key Lab of Digital Earth Science, CAS (2020-2021).
