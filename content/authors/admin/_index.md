I was a deep learning research intern at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (2020-2021). In the summer of 2021, I was working as a visiting student at Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), CAS. 

I am now working on computer vision problems with special focus on few-shot semantic segmentation under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). At the same time, I attend National Competition for undergraduate on Innovation Research & Experimental Design in Basic Medical Sciences with my teammates from the Department of Forensic Medicine, HUST.

My main research interests are within general deep learning theory and computer vision. My desire is to pursue solid and interpretable deep learning research in both application and theory aspects. I am now sincerely applying for a PHD as a rookie researcher with passion and determination.

**News:**
* **National Competition for undergraduate on Innovation Research & Experimental Design in Basic Medical Sciences 2022**    attendance.
* **SIAT-MMLab, CAS**    visiting student (2021.7-2021.9).
* **Key Lab of Digital Earth Science, CAS**    research intern (2020-2021).
