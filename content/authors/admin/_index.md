I am a 21-year-old Hong Kong junior majoring in Electronics Information Engineering, at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I am working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at HUST. In the summer 2021, I worked as a visiting student Multimedia Lab (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I was a research intern (remote) at Key Lab of Digital Earth Science, CAS (2020-2021). My academic interests are with in few-shot semantic segmentation, computer vision and deep learning. Besides, I am also insterested in probabilistic deep learning and graph neural networks. My academic desire is to fathom and decompose technical details as well as do solid and interpretable deep learning research. I am now sincerely applying for a PHD position in 2023 Fall.
