I obtained my B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering (Machine Intelligence) from [Huazhong University of Science & Technology (HUST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology). Currently, I am [CSIG](https://www.csig.org.cn) student member and a visiting student in [CAIRI AI Lab](https://github.com/Westlake-AI) under [Chair Prof. Stan Z. Li (IEEE Fellow, IAPR Fellow)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/). My research interests center around visual representation learning from 3 levels: **(i) Data-level:** Data mixing augmentation & label efficient learning. **(ii) Network-level:** Efficient network architecture design. **(iii) Framework-level:** Vector Quantization-based representation learning & pre-training. \
\
Previously, I worked on few-shot semantic segmentation fortunately advised by [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at [HUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology). In the summer of 2021, I was a visiting student at Multimedia Lab [(MMLab)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology [(SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I also conducted an internship at [Key Lab of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), CAS (2020-2021).

Welcome to contact me about research and internship.
