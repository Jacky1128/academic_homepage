I was a deep learning research intern at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (2020-2021). In the summer of 2021, I was working as a visiting student at Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), CAS. I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). 

My desire is to pursue solid and interpretable deep learning research in either application or theory aspect. My main research interests are within computer vision and deep learning. As a rookie researcher with clear mind and great research passion, I am now sincerely applying for a PHD in 2023 Fall. 

**News:**
* **National Competition for undergraduate on Innovation Research & Experimental Design in Basic Medical Sciences 2022**    Attendance. (present)
* **SIAT-MMLab, CAS**    Visiting student (2021.7-2021.9).
* **Key Lab of Digital Earth Science, CAS**    Research intern (2020-2021).
