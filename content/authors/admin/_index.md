I am a third-year undergraduate student at School of Electronics Information and Communication, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My current research interests are within visual representation learning and deep learning. Besides, I am also insterested in probabilistic deep learning and graph neural networks. 

I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation under Prof. Xinggang Wang at HUST. In the summer 2021, I worked as a visiting student at Multimedia Lab (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I was a research intern (remote) at Key Lab of Digital Earth Science, CAS (2020-2021).

Although I started out with computer vision, I would love to do deeper research within general deep learning and AI+ in the future. My academic desire is to fathom and get a good grasp of details of deep learning theory as well as do solid and interpretable deep learning research.  I am now applying for a PHD position in 2023 Fall.
