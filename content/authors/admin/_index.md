I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in Electronics Information Engineering at [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/). My research interests are within visual representation learning and cross-disciplinary AI+ applications. Since Sep. 2021, I have been a research intern at HUST visual learning team and I am now working on few-shot semantic segmentation under the supervision of [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ).  My academic goal is to do solid and interpretable deep learning research. \
\
In the summer of 2022, I became a research intern at [CAIRI](https://github.com/Westlake-AI) ([Prof. Stan Z. Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)'s Lab), [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/). Previously, I worked as a visiting student at [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I also conducted an internship (remote) at [Key Lab of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), CAS (2020-2021) focused on computer vision applied to remote sensing images.
