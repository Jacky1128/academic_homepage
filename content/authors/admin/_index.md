I am currently a visiting student in [CAIRI AI Lab](https://github.com/Westlake-AI) under [Chair Professor Stan Z. Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y-nyLGIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/). My research interests include efficient deep visual representation learning, especially for deep network architecture design as well as self-supervised learning, and AI+ cross-disciplinary applications. My goal is to pursue solid AI research that makes positive changes to the community. \
\
Previously, I worked on few-shot semantic segmentation under [Prof. Xinggang Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=qNCTLV0AAAAJ) at [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huazhong_University_of_Science_and_Technology). In the summer of 2021, I was a visiting student at Multimedia Lab [(MMLab)](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology [(SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I also conducted an internship at [Key Lab of Digital Earth Science](http://www.digitalearthlab.com.cn/), CAS (2020-2021).

Welcome to contact me about research and internship.
