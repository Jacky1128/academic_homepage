I am working on few-shot semantic segmentation problems under Prof. Xinggang Wang at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Druing the summer 2021, I fortunately worked as a visiting student of Multimedia Laboratory (MMLab), Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I was a deep learning research intern (remote) at Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, CAS (2020-2021).

My main research interests are within computer vision and deep learning, and my academic desire is to pursue solid and interpretable deep learning research under a relatively pure research environment. Therefore, as a young researcher with passion and clear mind, I am now sincerely applying for a PHD position in 2023 Fall.
